## Containers for Sprouting

### EasySprout

This is by far the most convenient sprouter I've tried.  It produces a huge amount of sprouts at once and it's easy to remove the hulls by stirring the sprouts and pouring off the hulls that float to the top.

However, sprouts grown in the EasySprout tend to be thin and pale in comparison to those grown on a tray-like sprouter like the [Sprout Master](#sprout-master) or the [Botanical Interests sprouter](#botanical-interests-sprouter).

One solution to the paleness problem is to remove the sprouts on the last day and spread them out to dry in the sun.

#### What Grows Well:

* [Red Clover-based mixes](#mix:-red-clover-based)

#### What Grows Poorly:

* [Kohlrabi](#kohlrabi) There was low yield and poor growth, although I had sanitized the seeds, so that's a confounding factor.

#### Amounts:

* Broccoli and brassica-based mixes: 2 tablespoons
* Red clover-based mixes: 2 tablespoons

### SproutMaster

#### What Grows Well:

* [Mung beans](#mung-beans) 
* [Broccoli](#broccoli)
* [Brassica-based mixes](#mix:-brassica-based)
* [Red Clover-based mixes](#mix:-red-clover-based)

#### What Grows Poorly:

### Botanical Interests Sprouter
### Vittorio Tiered Sprouter
### Glass Jar

Just don't.  

They're unweildy, they leak, they roll around, they can break, if there is any metal involved with the lid it rusts.  There are so many better options.
